This guide covers integration patterns with frameworks like React, Promise-based waiting, and UI animation synchronization.

**Modules used**: `adapters`, `play`

## React Demo

A working demo of waa-play with React. Uses `useSyncExternalStore` with `subscribeSnapshot` / `getSnapshot` to reactively manage playback state.

<ReactPlayerDemo client:load locale="en" />

### Demo Source Code

The core logic of this demo. UI rendering code is omitted.

<Code code={reactPlayerDemo} lang="tsx" />

## Code Examples

### 1. React Custom Hook

`subscribeSnapshot` and `getSnapshot` are directly compatible with React's `useSyncExternalStore`.

<Code code={reactHookPlayer} lang="tsx" />

**Explanation**: `subscribeSnapshot` subscribes to `statechange`, `timeupdate`, `seek`, and `ended` events, invoking the callback on changes. `getSnapshot` returns an immutable snapshot. These two functions map directly to the subscribe / getSnapshot parameters of `useSyncExternalStore`.

### 2. Promise-Based Waiting

You can wait for playback completion or position arrival using Promises.

<Code code={promiseWaitPlayer} lang="ts" />

**Explanation**: `whenEnded` returns a Promise that resolves on the `ended` event (natural completion). It does not resolve on manual `stop()`. `whenPosition` monitors the `timeupdate` event and resolves when the specified position is reached (or exceeded).

### 3. Smooth UI Animation

`onFrame` enables smooth progress bar and seeker updates based on `requestAnimationFrame`.

<Code code={smoothAnimationPlayer} lang="ts" />

**Explanation**: `onFrame` manages a `requestAnimationFrame` loop internally, passing a `PlaybackSnapshot` to the callback every frame. Calling the returned function stops the loop. This provides smoother updates than `timeupdate` (setInterval-based, default 50ms).

**Difference from `timeupdate` event**: `timeupdate` is setInterval-based and works in background tabs. `onFrame` is requestAnimationFrame-based, ideal for visual updates but pauses in the background.
