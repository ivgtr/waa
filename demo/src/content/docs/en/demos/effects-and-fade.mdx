import EffectsDemo from '../../../../components/demo/EffectsDemo.astro';

A demo of audio effect chains and fade functionality.

- **Gain**: Adjust volume in real-time
- **Filter**: Switch between Lowpass / Highpass / Bandpass, adjust frequency and Q
- **Fade**: Execute fade in/out

<EffectsDemo locale="en" />

## Code Examples

### Effect Chain

```ts
import { WaaPlayer } from "waa-play";

const player = new WaaPlayer();
const buffer = player.createSineBuffer(440, 3);

const gain = player.createGain(0.8);

const filter = player.ctx.createBiquadFilter();
filter.type = "lowpass";
filter.frequency.value = 1000;
filter.Q.value = 5;

player.chain(gain, filter, player.ctx.destination);

const playback = player.play(buffer, {
  through: [gain],
  loop: true,
});

// Modify parameters in real-time
filter.frequency.value = 500;
gain.gain.value = 0.5;
```

### Fade

```ts
// Fade in (0 → current gain value)
player.fadeIn(gain, 0.5); // 0.5 seconds

// Fade out (current gain value → 0)
player.fadeOut(gain, 1.0); // 1.0 seconds
```
