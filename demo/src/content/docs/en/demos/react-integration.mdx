import ReactPlayerDemo from '../../../../components/demo/ReactPlayerDemo.tsx';
import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { reactPlayerDemo } from '../../../../snippets/demos/react-integration';

A working demo of waa-play with React. Uses `useSyncExternalStore` with `subscribeSnapshot` / `getSnapshot` to reactively manage playback state.

<ReactPlayerDemo client:load locale="en" />

## Source Code

The complete source code of this demo.

<Code code={reactPlayerDemo} lang="tsx" />

## Key Points

- **`useSyncExternalStore`**: React 18+ official API for subscribing to external stores
- **`subscribeSnapshot`**: Subscribe to Playback state changes
- **`getSnapshot`**: Get the current `PlaybackSnapshot` (state, position, duration, progress)
- **`onFrame`**: `requestAnimationFrame`-based frame loop (for visualizers, etc.)
