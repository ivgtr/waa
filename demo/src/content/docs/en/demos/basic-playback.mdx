import BasicPlaybackDemo from '../../../../components/demo/BasicPlaybackDemo.astro';

Generate a synthesized tone or load an audio file to try waa-play's basic playback features.

- Sound generation (sine wave, white noise, click) or file loading
- Waveform display and seeking
- Play / Pause / Stop
- Volume, pan, speed, and loop controls

## Code Examples

### WaaPlayer API

```ts
import { WaaPlayer } from "waa-play";

const player = new WaaPlayer();
const buffer = player.createSineBuffer(440, 2);

const gain = player.createGain(0.8);
const panner = player.createPanner(0);

const playback = player.play(buffer, {
  through: [gain, panner],
  loop: true,
});

playback.on("timeupdate", ({ position, duration }) => {
  console.log(`${position.toFixed(1)}s / ${duration.toFixed(1)}s`);
});

playback.pause();
playback.resume();
playback.seek(1.0);
playback.setPlaybackRate(1.5);
playback.stop();

player.dispose();
```

### Function API (BYO AudioContext)

```ts
import { WaaPlayer } from "waa-play";

const ctx = new AudioContext({ sampleRate: 48000 });
const player = new WaaPlayer(ctx);

const buffer = await player.load("/drums.mp3");
const gain = player.createGain(0.8);
const comp = player.createCompressor({ ratio: 4 });

const a = player.play(buffer, { through: [gain, comp] });

a.on("ended", () => {
  player.play(buffer, { through: [gain, comp] });
});

player.dispose();
ctx.close();
```
